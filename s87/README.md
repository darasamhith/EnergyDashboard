# Renewable Energy Dashboard

## **Overview**
The Renewable Energy Dashboard is a React-based application designed to fetch, analyze, and display renewable energy data from an SQL database. It features user authentication, data summaries, detailed reports, and graphical visualizations to enhance user experience and understanding of renewable energy trends.

## **Features**
- **User Authentication:** Secure login functionality to access the dashboard.
- **Data Fetching:** Fetch renewable energy data directly from the SQL database.
- **Data Visualization:** Interactive charts and graphs to visualize trends and insights.
- **Reports:** Detailed summaries and reports on renewable energy usage and performance.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for desktop and mobile devices.

## **Technology Stack**
- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Backend:** Node.js (or specify if used), with RESTful API integration.
- **Database:** SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
- **Graphs/Charts:** Chart.js or D3.js
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

## **Installation**

### **Prerequisites**
- Node.js installed on your system
- Access to the SQL database (credentials/config)
- Git installed for cloning the repository

### **Steps**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install in both frontend and backend folders
   ```

   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   npm start in frontend
   node server.js in backend
   ```

## **Usage**
1. Navigate to the login page and enter valid credentials.
2. Explore the dashboard to view renewable energy data summaries.
3. Use the graph and report sections for detailed analysis.


## **API Endpoints**
Here are the backend API endpoints used by the application:
- `GET /api/summary`: Fetch summary data
- `GET /api/reports`: Fetch detailed reports
- `POST /api/login`: Authenticate user login

## **Future Enhancements**
- Add user role-based access control (e.g., admin, user).
- Implement filters for reports and graphs.
- Introduce real-time data updates using WebSockets.

## **Contributing**
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
3. Commit your changes:
